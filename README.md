# FSMTSAD(FSMTSA Dataset)

## Overview
The FSMTSA (Fatih Sultan Mehmet Target Sentiment Analysis) dataset is a comprehensive resource designed for sentiment analysis studies in Turkish. It includes text samples from diverse sources such as hotel reviews, restaurant reviews, movie critiques, product evaluations from e-commerce platforms, and social media posts (tweets). Additionally, the dataset is enriched with text samples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve data diversity and coverage.

This dataset has been expanded through data augmentation to provide an extensive representation of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, facilitating robust and unbiased sentiment analysis.

## Data Summary
- **Total Samples**: 15,853
- **Class Distribution**:
  - **Positive**: 5,284 (33.3%)
  - **Neutral**: 5,206 (32.8%)
  - **Negative**: 5,363 (33.8%)

## Data Sources
The data originates from a variety of real-world sources, including:
- Hotel, restaurant, and movie reviews
- E-commerce product reviews
- Social media posts (tweets)
- Texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)

For neutral samples, particular care was taken to select texts without explicit subjective judgments or with balanced opposing sentiments.

## Data Augmentation Techniques
1. **Back-Translation**:
   - Sentences were translated into English and then back into Turkish to introduce structural variations while preserving semantic meaning.

2. **Synonym Replacement**:
   - Key words in the text were replaced with their synonyms using the WordNet lexical database to create contextually equivalent variations.

During the augmentation process, duplicate entries were systematically removed to ensure data quality.

---

## Annotation Process
- The dataset was annotated manually by three independent annotators.
- In cases of disagreement, a majority vote was taken, with further validation by a supervisor.
- Disputed annotations were compared against outputs from at least three different LLMs for consistency.
- Sentiment classes are encoded as follows:
  - **-1**: Negative
  - **0**: Neutral
  - **1**: Positive
